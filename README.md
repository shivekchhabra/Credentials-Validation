## What does this repository contain?
This repository contains a small example of python integration with HTML.

I am trying to fetch the email and password from the users at the front end and validating them at the backend and returning results.

## How to use the repository?
To test simply install requirements by doing:
<pre><code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></pre>
and then run the flask app using:
<pre><code>flask run</code></pre>

After that you can simply double click the index file in "src/index.html"

To add more entries, you can add them in "validation_emails.csv"
